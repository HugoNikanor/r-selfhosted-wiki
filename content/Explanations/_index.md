#### Domain Names

Domain names are a word, phrase, or string that is used for navigating the internet. They are registered to individuals or legal entities in lengths of years for a set fee.

They are divided into levels, where each level is separated by a period. Domain registrations include the Top level and second level portion of a domain. All levels below are controlled by DNS at the discretion of the domain registrant.

Top level domains (TLDs) are .com, .net, .info, .edu, .org, etc.

The customizable part of the domain name you can register is called the second level domain.

Third level domains are referred to as *subdomains*.

Structure: subdomain.*secondleveldomain*.**tld**

EG: wiki.*r-selfhosted*.**com**

##### Domain Registration

Registering a domain name is done with a *Domain Registrar*. Prices are based on the top level domain, but all registrations are for a period of one year minimum.

Registrars come in two flavors:

- Accredited: These registrars work directly with ICANN or other regional Internet Registries for domain registrations.
- Domain Resellers: These companies work with a "white label" registrar to resell domain registrations for a small markup.

Accreditation requires quite a bit of infrastructure and vetting to make sure you can handle all aspects of registering and maintaining domains on behalf of the registrant.

Resellers are popular because of low overhead and easy implementation. Many "white label" registrars have turnkey solutions for resellers to appear as independent registrars while actually reselling domain names.

##### Which is right for you?

Choosing a domain registrar is easy. Picking a domain registrar that is trustworthy and reputable is less so.

Many domain registrars also offer to handle the DNS records for the domains registered with them. Many registrars have domain registration as a part of their business. Registration is usually bundled with webhosting or other related services. You may even get a domain registration for free if you agree to a year long hosting contract with a webhost.

While bundling related services together under one roof may sound convenient, it is generally advised against. It is recommended to have your domain registration with a registrar, DNS records with another company, and hosting with yet another entity. Common reasoning for this advice is that if your service provider has a serious outage or other technical problem, it can only affect one aspect of your online presence. If you have all services under one provider, a technical issue could prevent your DNS from resolving and your website/service from being served.

You can find a list of ICANN accredited domain registrars here: https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accreditation-qualified-list.html

As far as finding a reputable, trustworthy service provider, we must insist on your own research. One of the most popular forums for discussing hosting and related services is **[Web Hosting Talk](https://www.webhostingtalk.com/)**. If a relevant service provider has a bad reputation in the industry, you can surely find out about it here.

##### Domain Name System

The Domain Name System ( DNS ) is the method of defining what unique machines serve content for your domain.

The important parts of DNS you have to worry about are *nameservers* and *DNS records*.

##### Nameservers

Nameservers are a way to declare which servers are responsible for answering record requests for your domain. Most registrars provide DNS services, but if you have your DNS provided elsewhere, you will want to provide your primary and secondary nameservers to your registrar. The nameservers to use will be provided by your DNS service provider.

EG: ns1.dnsnameserver.net, ns2.dnsnameserver.net

##### DNS Records

DNS records are part of your domain name configuration called a DNS *zone*.

**SOA**: Start of Authority Records are generally handled by your DNS service provider automatically. They define:
- **MNAME**: Master nameserver for the zone
- **RNAME**: email for the domain administrator. Does not support "@", use periods. Periods before the domain name are escaped. EG: sum.gai@example.com => "sum\\.gai.example.com"
- **SERIAL**: The DNS zone **serial**, used to indicate when a zone has changed.
- **REFRESH**: Time to wait for secondary nameservers to query the master
- **RETRY**: Timeout for refreshing
- **EXPIRE** Threshold time for secondary nameservers to stop attempting to reach an unresponsive master server.
- **TTL**: The time to live to use for NXDOMAIN responses.

**Example SOA**:

```
    $TTL 86400
    @   IN  SOA     ns1.nameserver.com. postmaster.sumdomain.com. (
        2020080302  ;Serial
        7200        ;Refresh
        3600        ;Retry
        1209600     ;Expire
        3600        ;Negative response caching TTL
    )
```

The fields of a DNS zone record are:

- Domain: either the domain name or subdomain to create a record for.
- Time to Live: The time in seconds for a record to be cached before a new copy is requested.
- Class: Indicative of the namespace. Usually IN ( internet namespace ).
- Type: The type of record to define.
- Content: The content of the record. What is acceptable in this field is dependent on the type of record.

There are many types of DNS records, lets go over some common ones. This list is **not** exhaustive.

- A: A records tie the domain or subdomain to an IPv4 address.
- AAAA: AAAA records tie a domain or subdomain to an IPv6 address.
- CNAME: CNAME records tie a domain or subdomain to another domain or subdomain.
- MX: MX records are used to define how mail is handled for your domain. The content of an MX record is the priority and answering server domain name. Lower priority is higher.
- TXT: Text records associate text data with your domain. They are used for a variety of reasons, notable for SPF or DKIM.

| Domain | Time To Live | Class | Type | Content |
|--------|--------------|----|------|---------|
| example.com. | 86400  | IN | A    | 192.168.1.240 |
| ipv6.example.com. | 86400 | IN | AAAA | feef:00bb:2005:1eef:fbca:544d |
| www<span></span>.example.com. | 86400 | IN | CNAME | example.com. |
| example.com. | 86400 | IN | MX | 10 mail.mailserver.com |
| example.com. | 86400 | IN | TXT | "Reserved for a purpose I am not legally required to disclose." |

#### Reverse Proxies

Reverse proxies are daemons that accept connections and then connect to another service based on port or host to facilitate the request. They act as a middle man instead of a traffic redirector.

Typical use cases for reverse proxies are to provide a unified frontend for multiple backends or hosts. Another common use is for high-availability to provide failover or distribute load between multiple backends serving the same content.

Examples of popular software capable of performing as a reverse proxy are: squid, haproxy, apache, nginx, and caddy.

#### Port forwarding

Port forwarding is the function of inspecting traffic on an incoming port and redirecting it to another port or host with minimal modification. Primary purposes of this is to forward traffic to a service behind a firewall/router.

Common for hosting game servers from home when running dedicated servers before developers moved to match-making. Another use for this is to open ports for bittorrent so that you can share your vast and innumerable collection of Linux ISOs.

The difference between port forwarding and a reverse proxy is that the reverse proxy will accept, process, and establish a new connection to the backend service to fulfil the request.

Port forwarding inspects and alters packet headers before it is routed to its new destination. The connection is otherwise untouched.

Port forwarding is a function of your firewall. Commonly at the router or other network gateway.

Linux has one firewall called **iptables** with many frontends or management packages available for it. BSD based firewalls are **PF**, **IPFW**, and **IPFILTER**. The Windows firewall consists of a scarecrow holding a sign saying: "plz no tresspass".

#### Containers

Containers are software envelopes to isolate a piece or bundle of software and their dependencies. Containers come in may forms.

A container could contain a PHP based forum with an AMP stack (Apache, Maria DB, PHP ) as dependencies.

This is useful if you want an easy way to deploy software without configuring dependent software/libraries manually.

Containers can also resolve software conflicts when running multiple services which depend on different versions of the same software/libraries.

Popular containers are Linux Containers ( LXC ), jails ( BSD/Unix ), Kubernetes, and Docker.

#### Virtualization

Virtualization is a lower level form of containerization. There a many forms of virtualization that provide different sets of features/tradeoffs.

In practice, it often virtualizes whole, or major parts of an operating system.

##### Full virtualization

Full virtualization is generally the containerization of a full, unmodified operating system with virtualizaed hardware. The virtualized OS is not host-aware.

Fully virtualized guests require more overhead than paravirtualized guests. This can be mitigated with hardware support ( Intel VT, AMD SVM ) for virtualization instructions.

Examples of this are Hyper-V, Xen, KVM/Qemu, VMware ESX(i)

##### Para-Virtualization

Para-virtualization is the practice of running a modified kernel/OS where privileged instructions are sent through an API shared with the host. It does not require the virtualization of hardware, but it does require an operating system that is modified to be used with the specific API used by your chosen virtualization method. This can be in the form of source code modifications or specialized device drivers.

Microsoft Windows cannot be paravirtualized.

Examples: Xen, Oracle VM, OpenVZ.

#### Virtual Private Networks

Virtual Private Networks ( VPNs ) are a way of networking individual machines together in software regardless of their physical or network proximity.

A typical use case is for networking corporate locations together to share network resources such as file shares, intranet webservers, on-premesis services, etc.

Another use for a VPN is to tunnel traffic destined for a public service through to another endpoint, usually to bypass geo-location restrictions or state-imposed censorship of the internet.

Some use VPNs to keep services behind a restrictive ISP or firewall accessible outside of said network.
