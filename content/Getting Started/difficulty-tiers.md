### How hard *is* stuff?

Stuff can be hard. Stuff can also be easy. Some things here are hard. Some things are easy. Lets define some difficulty tiers.

#### Easy / Basic

No worries here man. Everything should be done with a gui with *maybe* some stuff needing a command or two, or maybe just editing some text files. Instructions should come in picture form.

Operating systems in this tier are Ubuntu Linux, Windows, or OSX.

### Normal / Intermediate

Still not hard, but you're expected to know how to not break things in a terminal or text based interface. Gui is optional, but used on occasion.

Operating systems in this tier are Debian Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Rocky Linux

### Hard / Advanced

You are at home with a terminal and all things can be accomplished with it. You know how not to break a system with a terminal, but also how to fix serious system level issues.

Operating systems in this tier are Arch, *BSD, Slackware Linux, Gentoo Linux.

### Guru / Expert

You compile your software from source and surf the web with lynx. If you don't know what that means you are a *poser*.

You run [Suicide Linux]("https://qntm.org/suicide") because anything less is for little babies.
