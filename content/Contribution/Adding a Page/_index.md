Title: Adding a Page
---


Adding pages with Hugo is easy! Each page has its own folder with an _index.md file. Make a new folder with an _index.md file inside.

The _index.md file looks like this

    ---
    Title: TITLE HERE
    Other metafields: metafield content
    ---

    Content!

See? It's easy!

Page content uses Markdown syntax for text styles, formatting, hyperlinks, and all kinds of stuff.
