Title: Modify a Page
---

Modifying a page is as simple as changing the _index.md file inside a folder.

    \ content
      _index.md <-- this here

        \ Subfolder
          _index.md   <-- or this one

        \ Subfolder2
          _index.md    <-- or even this one too

Hugo uses Markdown to format and style text, among other things.
